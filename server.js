//registering the bodyparser
//get the data stream in the body from the request covert it as applicable and make it available
//example:In this  we deal with json in the body.So this body parser will understand body is in json
//by looking at the header
//content type is a header value that indicate what type of data is in body
//in here type is application/json
//middleware you get request and response  and all the object
//example for middleware is this bodyparser which basically understand the type of the body and covert it to a actual type
//maybe authenticate middleware before it hitting routes it will authenticate the request whether it is coming authenticate source
//middleware execute some command on a request or response and it pass down to the next handler
